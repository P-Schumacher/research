This repository implements the HIRO algorithm for Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning on the original environment as presented by Ofir Nachum (Data-Efficient Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, 2018) 
Further work was conducted in order to adapt the algorithm to a robotic manipulation task while trying to solve the unique challenges that arise in such an environment.
